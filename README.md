# Windows-Tidy

This is a personal tool I built to keep my windows install tidy, it has a lot of hardcoded things, and is not meant for general availability.

If you want to use this, you will need to clone it and edit it to get it to work properly.

This is also meant to be used with the Windows task scheduler, by running `windows-tidy.exe checkwinget` and `windows-tidy.exe cleandotfiles` regularly.

There is no intention to get this to work on older versions of windows, nor on non-windows OSes.
If it does, it's purely incidental.
